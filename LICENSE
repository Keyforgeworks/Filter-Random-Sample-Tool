GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also
to any other work released this way by its writers. You can apply it
to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must convey to the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  Developers who use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
  (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For your protection, the GNU GPL has a built-in mechanism to make
  sure that the software cannot be turned against its users. When you
  modify the software, your modifications must also be free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" means copyright law.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
  an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
  the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or indirectly liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it.
  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
  modification), making available to the public, and in some countries
  other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means to propagate it, or to enable other people
  to propagate it.

 1. Conveying the Program.

  You may convey a covered work under the terms of this License, and you
  may not impose any additional restrictions on your or the recipients'
  exercise of the rights granted herein.  You must make sure that you,
  and any recipients you convey to, also receive or can get the
  source code of the Program along with the same license.

  You must convey the Program, including any modifications you make,
  under the terms of this License, and you must not impose any
  effective technical measures to obstruct or control the use or
  redistribution of the Program.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
  this License, provided that you also convey the complete
  corresponding machine-readable source code under the terms of this
  License, in a form suitable for the Program's and your modifications.
  You may convey the Program with other software under the same license
  or a compatible one, provided that you convey the complete
  corresponding machine-readable source code.

 2. Source Code.

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  For a covered work, complete source code
  means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.

  If a covered work is an executable, the complete source code means
  all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.

  You must provide access to the complete source code for the covered
  work, including the scripts to control compilation and installation of
  the executable.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention.

  A covered work must not be subject to effective technological measures
  or DRM that restrict a user's ability to exercise the rights granted
  under this License.  The Program must not be subject to any
  technological measure that would prevent the recipient from exercising
  the rights granted to them under this License.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
  the same license and copyright notices that you received with the
  Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
  you may offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a covered work based on the Program or a work based
  on the Program under the terms of this License, provided that you
  meet all of the following conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute, or that you
  propagate, to carry a notice stating that it is released under
  this License and referring to the copy of this License.

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  License, without any additional terms.

  d) You must provide, with the modified work, the complete
  machine-readable source code of the modified work, including all
  the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
  control compilation and installation of the executable.

  e) You must convey the modified work under the terms of this
  License.

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole, the distribution of
  the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
  for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and
  every part regardless of who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
  collective works based on the Program.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
  Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
  volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
  work under the scope of this License.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in non-source form, provided that you
  meet all of the following conditions:

  a) You must convey the complete corresponding machine-readable
  source code under the terms of this License, in a form suitable
  for the Program's and your modifications.

  b) You must provide, with the non-source form, a copy of this
  License.

  c) You must provide, with the non-source form, a written offer
  valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a
  charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
  distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
  corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
  this License.

  d) You must provide, with the non-source form, a notice stating
  that the non-source form is covered by this License.  You must
  provide, with the non-source form, a notice stating that the
  non-source form is covered by this License.

  e) You must not provide, with the non-source form, any
  technological measures that would prevent the recipient from
  exercising the rights granted to them under this License.

 7. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate
  or modify it is void, and automatically terminates your rights
  under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
  this License).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
  (a) provisionally and if the copyright holder has not explicitly
  terminated your license, and (b) permanently if the copyright
  holder has not notified you of the violation.

  Moreover, your rights under this License are terminated
  automatically if you initiate any legal action (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
  infringes any patent or violates any copyright or other intellectual
  property right.

  If the Program is subject to any patent or copyright
  infringement claim, you are hereby notified of your right to
  terminate the License under its terms.

 8. Patents.

  You may not propagate or modify the Program except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate
  or modify it is void, and automatically terminates your rights
  under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
  this License).

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Rights.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to exercise
  rights it gives you.  But you are not required to exercise
  rights it gives you.  But you are not required to exercise
  rights it gives you.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Your Contributions.

  You hereby declare that any contribution you make to the Program
  will be licensed under this License.

 11. Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies that it is governed by a particular version
  of this License, you may choose to follow the terms and conditions
  of that version or any later version published by the Free Software
  Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  by the Free Software Foundation.

  The GNU General Public License applies to all works released by
  writers who have not explicitly declared otherwise.
